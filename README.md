Introduction

This AI-based diabetes prediction system is designed to predict the risk of diabetes in individuals using machine learning techniques. The system takes various input features, such as medical history, genetics, and lifestyle factors, and provides a prediction of the likelihood of developing diabetes.

Prerequisites

Before you can run the code, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python (version 3.7 or higher)
- Required Python libraries (specified in `requirements.txt`)

You can install the required libraries using pip:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:


git clone https://github.com/TharunA1/NM_IBM_AI_G1.git


2. Change to the project directory:


cd diabetes-prediction system


 Usage

 Data Preparation

1. Prepare your dataset:
   - Create a CSV file with your data. The file should include features (independent variables) and the target variable (diabetes status).
   - Ensure that the data is properly cleaned and formatted.

2. Place your dataset in the `data/` directory within the project.

Training the Model

1. Run the training script to train the AI model:

python train.py --data_path data/your_dataset.csv --model_output_path models/


2. The trained model will be saved in the `models/` directory.

 Making Predictions

1. After training the model, you can make predictions on new data using the following command:

python predict.py --model_path models/your_model.pkl --input_data data/new_data.csv --output_path results/predictions.csv

2. The predictions will be saved in the `results/` directory.

Data Source

The dataset is taken from kaggle from the following link below:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/diabetes-data-set

This dataset includes the various data points and attributes related to individuals ,which are used for research, analysis, and the development of diabetes prediction models.
